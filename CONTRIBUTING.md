# Contributing to NVIDIA Agent Skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome contributions from the community — whether it's fixing a typo, improving documentation, or proposing a new skill.

## GitHub-First

All communication happens on GitHub. Please use:

- **Issues** for bug reports, feature requests, and questions
- **Discussions** for open-ended conversation, ideas, and show & tell
- **Pull Requests** for code and documentation changes

---

## How to Contribute

### Where to File Issues

- **New skill requests** — [open an issue in this repo](../../issues). Describe the use case, the product or workflow it would cover, and any relevant context.
- **Bugs or issues with an existing skill** — file the issue in the **source repo** where the skill originates (e.g., [NVIDIA/cuopt](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuopt) for cuOpt skills, [NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) for TensorRT-LLM skills). The maintainers of each product are best positioned to triage and fix skill-specific issues.
- **Issues with this repository itself** (README, structure, contribution process) — [open an issue here](../../issues).

### Improving Existing Skills

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b fix/skill-name-description`
3. Make your changes and test locally with a compatible agent.
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of the change.

### Submitting a New Skill for NVIDIA Verification

We accept community-authored skills into the `community/` directory. Once reviewed and approved by NVIDIA, verified skills are promoted to `skills/`.

#### Requirements

- Follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
- Include a `SKILL.md` with valid YAML frontmatter (`name` and `description` are required).
- Test your skill locally with your preferred agent before submitting.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, or proprietary dependencies without clear documentation.
- Keep skills focused — one skill should solve one clear problem.

#### Submission Process

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your skill to `community/<your-skill-name>/`.
3. Ensure your skill directory follows this structure:
   ```
   community/your-skill-name/
   ├── SKILL.md          # Required: skill definition
   ├── scripts/          # Optional: executable scripts
   ├── references/       # Optional: reference documents
   └── assets/           # Optional: static assets
   ```
4. Open a Pull Request with:
   - A description of what the skill does
   - Example usage
   - Any dependencies or requirements
5. NVIDIA will review for quality, security, and compatibility.
6. If approved, the skill is merged and may be promoted to `skills/` with the NVIDIA-verified badge.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
