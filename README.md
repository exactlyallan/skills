Skills are portable instruction sets that teach AI agents how to perform specialized tasks — from solving vehicle routing problems with GPU-accelerated cuOpt, to onboarding HuggingFace models into TensorRT-LLM AutoDeploy, to deploying real-time voice agents on Jetson and cloud NIMs, to launching LLM evaluations with NeMo Evaluator. Every skill listed here is **published and verified by NVIDIA**.

This repository is a **catalog** — skills are maintained in their respective product repos and linked here. It follows the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), making skills compatible with any AI agent or framework that supports the standard.

---

## Quickstart

Find a skill in the [Available Skills](#available-skills) table, clone it from the source repo, and copy it into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
# Example: install the cuOpt LP/MILP skill from the cuOpt repo
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuopt.git
cd cuopt && git sparse-checkout set skills/cuopt-lp-milp-api-python
cp -r skills/cuopt-lp-milp-api-python ~/.claude/skills/
```

That's it — the skill activates automatically the next time your agent encounters a relevant task. For example, ask your agent to "solve a linear programming problem with cuOpt" and the skill guides it through the cuOpt Python API.

### Install by Agent

| Agent / Framework | Installation |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Claude Code | Copy the skill directory into `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | Copy the skill directory into your project's `.codex/skills/` folder |
| Cursor | Copy the skill directory into your project's `.cursor/skills/` folder |
| Other agents | Copy the skill directory into your agent's skills folder |
